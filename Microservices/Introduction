1. It effects the way how we build the code and how we deploy the application in runtime.
2. For communication between microservices we can hardcode and let one service talk to the other.
  Or we can use SERVICE DISCOVERY for one service to talk to the other.
3. Problems we are solving with Microservices is we are
  a. Increasing Modularity
  b. Allowing Scalability
4. In a Monolith we are concerned about solving the problem of business/application
   where as in Miocroservices above the problem of application we have the problems
   that are generic like loadbalancing, service discovery which we need to address.

5. Complexity
  Monolith : Complexity is hidden within application
  Microservices: complexity is between the Services

6. Service Discovery is a Microservices Pattern:
  a. Service discovery is a pattern where microservices will be discovered and communicated with

7. What is a microservice and SOA?
SOA - Service oriented architecture is where a service or business logic is exposed for reusability
which is much like a utility where the specific use of the service may not be defined

Microservice - it is a service broken from a Monolith or a Complete Application. It has clear defnition
of what it is a what is the purpose of it.

Keeping The definitions aside both of them have the same or common philosophies.
