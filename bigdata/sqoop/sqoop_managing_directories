--delete-target-dir
this parameter in the sqoop import command will delete the folder if it is already present or will ignore.
so that it will not throw error.

--append
this will add files to the same directory.
[Append will not overwrite but just add the new data to the old dataset. It may also include duplicate data set]
--append and --delete-target-dir  are mutually exclusive and we cannot use both of them at the same time
