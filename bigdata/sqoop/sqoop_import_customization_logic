1. Sqoop had default 4 mappers and which we can customize using --num-mappers

2. Sqoop uses the primary key for split logic if the primary key is present in the schema

3. If the schema does not have primary key and if we use number of mappers more than 1 then the
   Sqoop import will fail.

4. So we can use parameter --split-by to specify a field by which we want to split the data. [If there is no primary key defined]
  or define the number of mappers to 1 exclusively. or --auto-rest-to-one-mapper

5. What happens if the non primary key used to split is non-numeric?
    Then we have to pass an extra argument -Dorg.apache.sqoop.splitter.allow_text_splitter=true
