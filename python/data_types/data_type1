1. Tuple: It is a list of items enclosed in (), and which is immutable. That is there is no append function on the tuple
tuple1 = ("fruit1","fruit2")
this is a tuple

2. we can use "type" class to get the type of a class/
example: print(type({1,2,3,4}))
this will print <class set>

3. what are the types of arrays in python :
Lists : []
Sets: {}
Tuples: ()

4. tuples are immutable, so we don't have concatenation in a tuple
