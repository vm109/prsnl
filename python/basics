1. In python we dont have ++ or -- rather we use += or -= for increment.
2. Strings in python are list of characters and so strings will inherit most of the list
predefined functions
3. we can extract substring from strings. s[lowrange: highrange]
  highrange -> is exclusive
4. we have validation functions in strings
  isnum(), isalnum(), islower()
