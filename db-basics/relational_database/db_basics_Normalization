1. Normalization - It is all about defining the relation between the tables.
  Normalization is based on the mathematical principles.
  example : if a table has the following fields order_date, customer_name, customer_address, item_id, item_price, item_quantity
  then we will possibly repeat the customer_name and customer_address multiple times for each item.

  So, by Normalization we split the table into customer table and items table. So we reduce the redundancy.

2. What are the problems that the normalization will address?
  a. Insertion anomaly [ Say we have table employee_id, employee_name, subject In this case we may not be able to insert a record
     because that employee may be a new hire a not yet assigned a course]
  b. Update anomaly [If same information is present on multiple rows then while updating we might miss some rows and result
     inconsistency]
  c. Deletion anomaly

3. We can create a logical model by using ER diagrams and the script from logical model to create physical tables or tables in
database

4. 1st Normal Form - Data should not be repeated, all the columns should have atomic data.

example: venkat, netaji street, [7032017321,4567890046]
so in the example phone two phone numbers are present in the same column which is not allowed in 1N form

5. what is candidate key in dbms?
candidate key is a field or combination of fields in a table which will uniquely identify records in a table.

6. What is a functional dependency in dbms?
If a record in database table has X and Y where X is set of attributes which form the candidate key and Y are the set of
attributes which are non-key, then X should be able to uniquely identify the record

7. 2nd Normal Form - For a table to be 2nd Normal form it has to be 1st Normal form.
  And in the a-forth mentioned functional dependency the attributes Y should be dependent on X. [there should not be
  any partial dependency on the candidate key] example : score_id	student_id	subject_id	marks	teacher_name [ teacher name has partial dependency on
  subject_id where the candidate key is student_id+subject_id]

  If there are any attributes in set Y such that they can identify the record then the other attributes are functionally dependent
  on non-candidate key.

8. Surrogate Key - It is a unique identifier of a record, which is typically system generated.


9. Representation of ER diagrams,
   fork represents many. direction will show which entity has many relation

10. 3rd Normal From -
  Should satisfy 2nd Normal form and there should not be any Transitive Dependency

  Transitive Dependency - That is a non primary key attribute is dependent on another non primary key attribute

11. What is BCNF - when we have candidate key then we have to take care of BCNF
