1. Why do we need relational database and what is the advantage of non-relational database or nosql?
Relational database -
  1. It organizes the data by normalization.
  2. we can chose sql when we have a clear data model at hand.
  3. It organizes the data but it equally makes hard to denormalize data and get data from multiple tables.
  4. sql is a good choice when we have a more structured model and we need multi-row transactions
Nosql -
  1. It does not need to have a rigid datamodel
  2. All the data of a record is stored in one place. By denormalization.
  3. scalability is done horizontally, that is adding more servers on to the database.
  4. Nosql is for companies which needs to analyze much larger set of data.
  5. Managing answers to very tactical questions that look across data that is  >= triple digits  petabytes is hard for relational data bases.
