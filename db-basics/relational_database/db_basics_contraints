1. What are the constraints in a Database?
  a. PRIMARY Key
  b. SECONDARY KEY
  c. CHECK constraint

2. PRIMARY KEY -  when a field in the database is defined as primary key then the field will have unique values
    and not null values.
3. SECONDARY/ FOREIGN KEY - foreign key defines the dependency between two tables

4. CHECK CONSTRAINT - check constraint will add custom checks onto tables. That is while adding age to age field
  we can have check constraint where it will restrict adding any age less than 18

5. Adding a Constraint onto a table
  ALTER {table_name} CONSTRAINT {key name} PRIMARY KEY / FOREIGN KEY ( {field name} )
